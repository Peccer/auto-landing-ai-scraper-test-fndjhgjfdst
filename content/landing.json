    {
      "question": "How is this different from traditional scrapers with CSS selectors?",
      "answer": "Classic scrapers rely on brittle rules that break when layouts change. Our AI understands page content semantically, so you can request fields in plain English and get consistent, structured outputs\u2014even as sites evolve\u2014dramatically reducing setup and maintenance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it work on dynamic, JavaScript-heavy sites or pages behind simple flows?",
      "answer": "Yes. We use real browser automation to render dynamic content, support pagination and common flows, and extract reliably from modern front-ends. For heavily protected or complex workflows, our managed DaaS team can configure and monitor bespoke runs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is web scraping legal and compliant?",
      "answer": "Always follow applicable laws, website terms, and ethical guidelines. We provide controls for respectful crawling (e.g., rate limits, rules adherence) and options to avoid collecting sensitive data. If in doubt, consult your legal counsel regarding your specific use case."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the AI compared to rule-based scrapers?",
      "answer": "The AI uses large language models to interpret context and labels, producing stable, schema-consistent results across layout variations. You can define target fields and validation rules, and we offer monitoring and QA options to keep accuracy high over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get the data into my stack?",
      "answer": "Export to JSON/CSV/Excel or stream via API and webhooks. Send data to cloud storage or databases, or plug it into your ETL/ELT and BI tools. The output schema is consistent and ready for downstream analytics and modeling."

Optional URL input demo: a simple field to paste a page URL + \u2018Extract sample\u2019 to reduce perceived complexity. 2) Trust signals above the fold: customer logos, uptime %, SOC 2/GDPR badges, \u2018Respects robots.txt by default\u2019 note to emphasize ethical compliance. 3) Feature/value grid (3\u20136 cards): AI-assisted selector training, anti-bot evasion & rotation, scheduling, ETL/export (CSV/JSON/Parquet/S3/BigQuery), structured schema mapping, monitoring & alerts. 4) Code-first section: Tabs for Python/Node/cURL with copy-to-clipboard, one-liner quickstart, and a live-key masked example. 5) Use cases by audience: developers (API & SDK), analysts (no-code templates), marketing (SERP/pricing), ops (monitoring), research (compliance). Include outcome metrics (time saved, accuracy). 6) Interactive proof: mini \u2018template gallery\u2019 or wizard to choose site type and output fields; show the resulting schema preview. 7) Social proof: testimonial with measurable result, star rating, link to case studies. 8) Pricing: transparent tiers with monthly/annual toggle, usage caps visualized as bars; \u2018Compare plans\u2019 drawer. Show Fair Use & compliance note. 9) Reliability & security: architecture diagram, IP rotation, encryption, data residency, audit logs, status page link, SLA. 10) Footer: docs, SDKs, status, security, legal, acceptable use, contact. Conversion principles: one dominant CTA color (Primary), accent for positive confirmations (Accent). Keep primary CTA persistent (sticky on mobile). Remove friction: email-only signup, SSO options, immediate trial with limited credits. Use progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelm. Encourage momentum: onboarding checklist with progress bar. Urgency ethically: indicate remaining free credits. Accessibility/usability baked-in: visible focus rings (3 px, high-contrast), 44\u00d744 px touch targets, never use color alone to denote status (add icons/labels), descriptive form labels and helper text, inline validation with specific guidance, ARIA-live regions for async actions, motion reduced via prefers-reduced-motion, skeleton loaders for perceived performance, keyboard-accessible tabs/menus, charts with data tables and accessible descriptions. Information density: carded sections with 16\u201324 px padding, 8\u201312 px corner radius, soft shadows for elevation.
